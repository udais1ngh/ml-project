"Oopps!! Your apple plant is infected by Black Rots. This infection is a fungal infection. To control balck rot, remove the cankers by pruning at least 15 inches below the end and burn or bury them. Treating the sites with the antibiotic streptomycin or a copper-based fungicide will be helpful."
"Yaayy!! Your apple plant is healthy. But, maintain the soil pH of 6.0 to 7.0 for healthy growth. Avoid planting apples in a low spot where cold air or frost can settle."
Oopps!! Your corn plant is infected by Northern Leaf Blight. The primary management strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of NCLB is planting resistant products. Using fungicides is also helpful.
"Yaayy!! Your corn plant is healthy. But, maintain the soil consistently moist, but not soggy and only need fertilizer every 6 months. It prefers temperatures of 75 to 80 degrees F."
"Oopps!! Your peach plant is infected by Bacterial Spots. This is a difficult disease to control when environmental conditions favor pathogen spread. Compounds for the treatment include copper, oxytetracycline (Mycoshield and generic equivalents), and syllit+captan; however, repeated applications are typically necessary for even minimal disease control."
"Yaayy!! Your peach plant is healthy. But, you should have deep sandy soil that ranges from a loam to a clay loam for healthy growth. Poor drainage in the soil will kill the root system of growing peach trees, so make sure the soil is well drained. Growing peach trees prefer a soil pH of around 6.5."
